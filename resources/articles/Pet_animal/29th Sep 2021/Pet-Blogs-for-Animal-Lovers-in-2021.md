## WHAT IS DIABETES?

This type of diabetes happens when the dog’s body isn’t producing enough insulin. This occurs when the pancreas is damaged or not functioning. Daily shots are necessary to replace the missing or insufficient insulin. This is the most common type of diabetes in dogs.
This is when the dog's body isn't utilizing the insulin produced by the pancreas as it is supposed to. The cells are failing to absorb glucose from the blood. This type of diabetes is seen in older or obese dogs. Female dogs too tend to develop resistance to insulin when in heat or pregnant.

## DIAGNOSIS

Don't go about overthinking about your dog showing some signs of the disease. Contact your veterinary doctor, they are skilled enough to check for diabetes using simple tests to check the glucose levels in your dogs' blood and urine. Blood tests will also reveal other signs such as high liver enzymes and electrolytic imbalances that indicate diabetes. Early detection will only help result in earlier treatment, thus improving the chances of the dog having a normal life.

## DAMAGE CAUSED BY DIABETES:
Health threats: Diabetes if not detected early may lead to harmful effects on a dog's body. Early detection and immediate treatment are key when it comes to diabetes. Neglecting the symptoms may lead to devastating complications.

-Cataracts, which may result in blindness
-Kidney failure
-Urinary tract infections
-Enlarged liver
-Seizures
-Ketoacidosis

No matter the type, the effects on the body are equally negative. Excess sugar gets built in the dog's blood and the cells are not able to benefit from it due to lack of insulin. Critical consequences of diabetes include the cells breaking down fats and proteins to replace its need for glucose as fuel for energy. In other cases, organs are damaged because of the high sugar levels in the blood. As there is no insulin to convert the glucose in the blood to fuel, this sugar reaches organs and acts as a poison causing multiple organ damage. Diabetes severely affects kidneys, eyes, heart, blood vessels and/or nerves.
