- ## Plan your animal friendly trip ##
    - ### Before you go checklist
       -  You can protect animals on your holidays by being informed and alert to
        the welfare of the animals you encounter. Make good decisions for animals
        when you travel by following these simple steps:
            - **Do your research:** investigate the venues you intend to visit. If animal
            encounters are offered, how are the animals treated and where did they
            come from?
            - **Ask questions:** check if your tour operator or travel agent has
            an animal welfare policy. Ask your friends and family about
            their experiences.
           -  **Make positive choices:** support tourism that does not exploit wild
            animals.
           -  **Eat ethically:** when trying local exotic foods, ask if the animal is rare
            or endangered, which is often illegal.
           -  **Think before you buy:** Consider what may be a locally-produced
            animal souvenir may actually drive demand for the illegal trade in
            wildlife.
          -  **Think about culture:** always be respectful when you travel, but
            remember that culture is not an excuse for cruelty
